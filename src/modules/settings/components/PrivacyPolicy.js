Capitalized terms used herein shall be as defined in the Terms. </p> <ol> <li><b>SITE ACCESS. </b>Access to the Site will be obtained through the processes as explained further in the Terms. </li> <li><b>PERSONAL INFORMATION. </b>We collect and use Personal Information to provide Services to our Users and to facilitate communication between you and us. This information will be provided through modes that include but are not limited to registrations, surveys, and chat sessions. In addition, InquisitHealth uses Personal Information as needed, for research, maintenance and operation of the Site. When you register for our Services you may voluntarily submit Personal Information with regard to demographics, clinical information (including but not limited to illness, diagnosis, and treatment), personal preferences, contact information, and availability. Upon confirmation of this information, you will receive a username and password. Not all information that you provide will be required in order for you to log into web-based platform. You have the right to "opt-out" of our use of your Personal Information. Please understand that if you opt-out of providing your Personal Information, you will not be able to participate in our Services as a User. <p>Additionally, if you are registered in our Services as a "Peer" and are eligible to refer a "Care Partner" for program participation, we will ask you for the Care Partner\'s name, e-mail address, and phone number. Upon receipt of this information, we will use it to contact your chosen Care Partner by e-mail to invite him or her to receive Content from our Services. By inviting a Care Partner to be a part of the mentor program, you consent to disclosing your personal information to this person; personal information includes information about your health and progress in the program. We cannot control whether or how these persons will use your personal information or if they will disclose it. If you do not consent to the disclosure of this information to the Care Partner, you should not invite them to participate in the program.</p> </li> <li><b>HOW WE WILL USE YOUR INFORMATION. </b>In addition to the specific uses of information we have explained in the previous clause ("PERSONAL INFORMATION"), we may use your information that we receive for the following purposes: help you efficiently access your user account; remember information so you do not have to re-enter it every time you use our Services; send tailored content to you and others; improve, test, and monitor our Services\' efficacy; build and test new products and features; monitor information like total number of visits, Internet traffic, and demographics; troubleshoot; enact automatic updates. </li> <li><b>UPDATING AND REMOVING PERSONAL INFORMATION. </b>After creating an Account (as explained in the Terms and Conditions), Users will be able to access their Account and modify their Personal Information at any time. Any changes made will be reflected in your Account, but you may not delete the previously entered information from our internal systems.</li> <li><b>DISCLOSURE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</b>. Except as otherwise stated in this Privacy Policy, we do not trade, rent, or share your Personal Information with third parties unless you ask us to do so. We may disclose your Personal Information if we believe in good faith that such disclosure is necessary to (a) comply with relevant laws or to respond to subpoenas or warrants served on InquisitHealth; (b) if we have reason to believe that a User is likely to cause bodily harm to him or herself or others; or (c) to protect and defend the rights or property of InquisitHealth or third parties. We may also share collective demographic information and other de-identified information to entities who may be interested in using, learning about, or licensing our Services. No identifying information will be shared with these entities; we will only share de-identified and anonymized information that reflects the types of persons who are using our Services and purposes for using our Services. We may also access, keep, and share information for purposes of detecting and preventing fraudulent and illegal activity, to protect ourselves, you, and others, and to prevent imminent harm (InquisitHealth does not agree to any obligation to do so). In some cases, we may also share information from tools like Cookies, log files, device identifiers, and location data, with third-party organizations that work with us to provide Services to you â€“ these entities are called "Service Providers".

We also take reasonable steps (such as requiring a unique password) to confirm your identity before allowing access to your account). Even though we have taken significant steps to ensure that your Personal Information is not intercepted, accessed, used, or disclosed by unauthorized persons, we cannot fully eliminate security risks associated with Personal Information. Following the termination or deactivation of your account on our web-based platform and/or mobile application, InquisitHealth may retain information and content for backup, archival, and audit purposes.

You agree that we are not to be held responsible for data breaches that happen before data reaches our serves. <p>We may also collect, monitor, gain access to, and store "device identifiers" either on your device or remotely. Device identifiers are small data files or similar data structures stored on or associated with your mobile device, which uniquely identify your mobile device. A device identifier may be data stored in connection with the device hardware, data stored in connection with the device\'s operating system or other software, or data sent to the device by PeerMentor. A device identifier may be used to send personalized content. Some parts of our Services may not operate properly if use or availability of these Device Identifiers becomes faulty or disabled.</p> <p>We use third-party analytics tools to assist us in measuring usage trends and user traffic for our Services. These tools are meant to gather information and data sent by your device or our Services.
